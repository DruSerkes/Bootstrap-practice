Springboard: Bootstrap Practice!


**
What the assignment was about:

I had to make 2 sample pages with Bootstrap. 

**
What I did: 

I included the css and javascript for the Bootstrap framework, then built 2 web pages based off of 
2 PDF's I was given.

** 
What I learned: 

I love this framework! Easy to use. Looks great. I love that I can create a clean, styled page in one file in a short period of time. 

**
Looking forward: 

Things change for me as I continue to learn, but this is a game-changer. As of now, I see myself utilizing Bootstrap (and similar frameworks)
to efficiently create easy-to-look-at landing pages for pretty much every personal project I currently have in mind.
